# turism agency project in java
Simple application that provides functionality for searching, ordering 
a trip on behalf of the Client. Also an analogue of a personal account with
your orders and data.

From the Manager's side, the application provides functionality for :
- creating, editing, deleting Client profiles;
- processing Client applications for a trip;
- a page with analytical data;
- a page with Manager's data;

To run this project, you need to : 
1. Download and Configure JavaFX in Project (I used JavaFX 21)
2. Have on your working machine PosgtreSQL & pgAdmin
3. Import Database Backup from my project's main folder to your server 

I think that's all that it takes to run this app. 

If I forgot to say anything about setting up the project to run, then I apologize. <3
